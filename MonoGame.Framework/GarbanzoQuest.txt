Open DesktopGL in Visual Studio Community
Right Click DesktopGL and select pack

You might run into this issue:
Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	CS0579	Duplicate 'global::System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute' attribute	MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL	C:\Users\zachi\Creative\GameDevelopment\MonoGame\ThirdParty\StbImageWriteSharp\src\obj\Debug\netstandard2.0\.NETStandard,Version=v2.0.AssemblyAttributes.cs	4	Active

I have no idea why it happens or how to fix it for real, but you have to delete the local repo and re-pull it form GitHub to get it to go away.
